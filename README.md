**Scientific research tools and workflow**

This repository is a long term quest for the Holy Grail of an ideal research workflow. Although this ideal is not achievable in practice, the following features are implicitly driving my search.

- Minimalistic and lightweight.
- Programming language agnostic.
- Supports robust code and data collaboration.
- Flexible to adapt to various computational environments.
  - local or cloud
  - personal machine or research cluster
  - Windows, Mac or Liunx
- Supports static and interactive report generation, including scientific manuscripts.
- Can survive if components are no longer maintained.
- Does not depend on propritary software.
- Modular within and between projects.
- Scales in code, data and team size.
